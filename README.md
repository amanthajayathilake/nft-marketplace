# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

First Enter your secret in .secret file. Then,

1) npm run dev
2) npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
3) npx hardhat node
